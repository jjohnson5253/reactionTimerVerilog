# Reaction Timer in Verilog
This project turns an Altera DE0 FPGA board into a Reaction Timer. When the user presses the button on the board, a random pause time is initiated. Once that time is up, an LED lights on indicating that the user should press the button again. The duration of the LED being on is timed as the user's reaction time and then displayed on the 7-segment display.
